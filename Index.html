            <h2>World Leaders Meet for Climate
                Summit</h2><br>
            <time datetime="datetime">10 Nov, 2025</time><br>
            <img src="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/hrahigsr/cop30.png" alt="Climate_summit.png">
            <p>In his opening remarks at the climate summit plenary session, President Costa emphasized the critical
                timing of COP30 in the fight against climate change and the need for multilateral action to face the
                climate emergency.

                COP30 is taking place at a decisive moment in our fight against climate change. The window of
                opportunity to act and avoid irreversible impacts on humanity and nature is closing fast. The
                existential threat posed by climate change in particular impels the European Union’s unwavering
                commitment to the Paris Agreement.

                -President Costa

                President Costa underlined the EU's commitment to clear climate goals and solidarity with those most
                at risk.

                As net greenhouse gas emissions fell by 37% between 1990 and 2023 in the EU - despite the economy
                growing by 68% - the EU remains convinced that this is the right path to reducing emissions by 55%
                by 2030 and achieving climate neutrality by 2050. </p>

            <h2>Back to Back champions</h2>
            <time datetime="datetime">11 Nov, 2025</time>
            <img src="https://digitalhub.fifa.com/transform/fa285d54-f8ac-455f-9299-f3bc455dca67/79034232?&io=transform:fill,height:910,width:1536&quality=75"

            <p>France came agonisingly close to joining an elite two-nation club when they were beaten in perhaps the
                greatest FIFA World Cup™ final of all time at Qatar 2022.

                Argentina’s penalty shootout victory prevented Les Bleus retaining the title they won at Russia 2018 –
                and joining Italy and Brazil as the only teams to have won back-to-back World Cups.

                Unstoppable Azzurri
                The Italians were the first to achieve the feat. Having lifted the trophy on their home turf in 1934,
                beating Czechoslovakia in the final, they headed to France 1938 in ominous form. Under the leadership of
                legendary coach Vittorio Pozzo, they were in the midst of an unbeaten run which eventually ran to 30
                matches and spanned four years from 1935 to 1939.

                That sequence included a triumphant Olympic Football Tournament campaign in 1936 and the successful
                defence of their World Cup crown two years later. Italy overcame Norway, France and Brazil on their way
                to the championship match, where they beat Hungary 4-2 in a thrilling clash.
